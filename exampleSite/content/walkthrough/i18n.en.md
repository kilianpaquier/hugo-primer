Since Hugo has it pre-configured, internationalization is of course available with this theme ! How to ?
Easy, by defining in configuration file `hugo.(yaml|toml)` available languages for your own website:

```yaml
languageCode: en
defaultContentLanguage: en

languages:
  fr:
    contentDir: content
    languageName: Fran√ßais
    params:
      pre: /static/primer/globe-16.svg # display an icon before language name in languages choice
  en:
    contentDir: content
    languageName: English
    params:
      pre: /static/primer/globe-16.svg # display an icon before language name in languages choice
```

This above code snippet is an example, more information can be found [here](https://gohugo.io/methods/site/languages/) on how to configure languages with Hugo.
