Welcome on **hugo-primer** theme!

This theme is greatly inspired of [**github-style**](https://github.com/MeiK2333/github-style) theme with more up-to-date styles
but also more extensibility (all details in [walkthrough](/walkthrough)).

**Primer** ? It's **GitHub** *Design System*, for which you can find the official website [here](https://primer.style/).

This theme is 100% based on **Primer** styles:

- [**@primer/primitives**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@primer/primitives)
- [**@primer/css**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@primer/css)
- [**@primer/view-components**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@primer/view-components)
- [**@primer/react**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@primer/react)

Many examples of **Primer** components can be found [here](https://primer.style/product/components/),
whether it may be used in a more advanced use of this theme or for another use (a complete **React** project).

As it's the overview page, and that reusing without **React** those components was a small hell,
here is some (very) useful links to access styles directly:

- https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@primer/react@37/dist/components.css
- https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@primer/view-components@0/app/assets/styles/primer_view_components.css (no pretty)
- https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@primer/view-components@0/app/assets/javascripts/primer_view_components.js (no pretty)
